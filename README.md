This application helps manage employees and thier salaries. Ive added the functionality for adding employees and displaying the average salary as well as a random employee picker for a drawing. In adding this functionality I have learned how to verify input ad how to handle NaN and emptystrings.




## Usage


To add employees click the add employees button and input thier information. to stop adding select cancel when asked if you want to keep adding.
To view the average salary and randomly selected employee open the console by right clicking and selecting inspect.
